# Task Quotes and 3-Stage Approval System

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the task quotes system with a 3-stage approval process for vendor quotes, as requested in the user requirements.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Task Creation Form
- **Tools Required**: Made mandatory with improved UI and validation
- **Number of Hours Required**: Made mandatory with clear labeling
- **Skills Required**: Made mandatory with enhanced descriptions
- All fields now have proper icons and validation messages

### 2. Task Quotes Database Schema
- New `task_quotes` table with comprehensive fields:
  - Quote details (amount, hours, message, tools provided, additional services)
  - 3-stage approval status tracking
  - Timestamps for each approval stage
  - User tracking for each approval action

### 3. 3-Stage Approval System

#### Stage 1: Price Approval
- Client reviews and approves the vendor's quote amount
- System tracks approval timestamp and approver
- Notification sent to vendor upon approval

#### Stage 2: Task Review/Approval
- Client reviews the task requirements and vendor proposal
- Can only proceed after price approval
- System tracks review timestamp and reviewer
- Notification sent to vendor upon approval

#### Stage 3: Customer Details Release
- Client releases their contact information to the vendor
- Can only proceed after price and task review approval
- Includes customer details in notification (name, phone, email, address)
- Work can commence within 24 hours after release

### 4. Backend API Implementation
- **POST `/api/tasks/:id/quotes`**: Submit a quote for a task
- **GET `/api/tasks/:id/quotes`**: Get quotes for a task (client sees all, provider sees own)
- **POST `/api/tasks/:id/quotes/approve-price`**: Stage 1 approval
- **POST `/api/tasks/:id/quotes/approve-task`**: Stage 2 approval
- **POST `/api/tasks/:id/quotes/release-customer-details`**: Stage 3 approval

### 5. Frontend Components

- Real-time updates after quote submission
- Integration with existing verification system

### 6. Database Storage Implementation
- Complete implementation in both MemStorage and DatabaseStorage
- Proper relations and foreign key constraints
- Type-safe operations with Zod validation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Migration
- Generated migration file: `migrations/0004_cool_marvel_boy.sql`
- Includes all necessary foreign key constraints
- Proper indexing for performance

### Schema Design
```sql
CREATE TABLE "task_quotes" (
  "id" serial PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  "task_id" integer NOT NULL,
  "provider_id" integer NOT NULL,
  "quote_amount" double precision NOT NULL,
  "estimated_hours" integer NOT NULL,
  "message" text NOT NULL,
  "tools_provided" text,
  "additional_services" text,
  "price_approved" boolean DEFAULT false,
  "price_approved_at" timestamp,
  "price_approved_by" integer,
  "task_reviewed" boolean DEFAULT false,
  "task_reviewed_at" timestamp,
  "task_reviewed_by" integer,
  "customer_details_released" boolean DEFAULT false,
  "customer_details_released_at" timestamp,
  "customer_details_released_by" integer,
  "status" text DEFAULT 'pending' NOT NULL,
  "created_at" timestamp DEFAULT now(),
  "updated_at" timestamp DEFAULT now()
);
```

### API Flow
1. **Provider submits quote** → Creates task quote record
2. **Client approves price** → Updates quote with price approval
3. **Client approves task review** → Updates quote with task review approval
4. **Client releases customer details** → Updates quote and sends details to provider

### Security Features
- Role-based access control (only clients can approve, only providers can submit)
- Sequential approval requirements (must complete previous stage)
- Proper validation and error handling
- Session-based authentication
